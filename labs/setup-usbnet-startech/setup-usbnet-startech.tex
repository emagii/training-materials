\subchapter{Setting up a Startech USB - Ethernet adapter}
{Objective: Get a dedicated network port for communication with the \devboard}

After this lab, you have a second network port allowing you to nfs-mount the \devboard
root filesystem without changing the network settings of the primary network port.

\section{Prerequisites}

You need a {\bf Startech USB31000SW USB Ethernet}  adapter

It is assumed, that your system is setup to build kernel modules.

This means that kernel source build directory must be present

\begin{verbatim}
ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
\end{verbatim}

\section{Preparing to build kernel drivers}

If you did not run \code{make prepare} in \labdir, you need to do this now.

\section{Build and install the kernel driver}

Go to the \labdir directory 

The \code{network/startech} directory contains a tarball with the driver.

The tarball has been downloaded from the Startech website, and slightly
modified to allow it to build.

You can compile and install the driver by:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo make -C network startech-usb
\end{verbatim}

\section{Build and install the kernel driver outside the lab}

Extract the tarball, and enter the source directory.

\begin{verbatim}
make
sudo make install
\end{verbatim}
