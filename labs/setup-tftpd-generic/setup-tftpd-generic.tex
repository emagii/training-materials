\subchapter{Setting up a TFTP Server}{Objectives:
Set up TFTP communication with the development workstation.}

\section{Install the TFTPD server}

In the following sections you will get instructions on how to
setup the \code{tftpd} and \code{tftpd-hpa} servers.

Only one of them can be active in a system.

If you have \code{xinetd} present in the system, use \code{tftpd}.

(Check if \code{/etc/xinetd.d} exists)

If it does not exist, install \code{tftpd-hpa}

You should also make sure that the corresponding \code{tftp} client
is available. Check with \code{synaptic} that it is installed.
