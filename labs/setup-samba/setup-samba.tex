\subchapter{Samba Setup}{Open up the lab directory}

\section{Install Samba}

If you did not run \code{make prepare}, 
install \code{samba} and \code{system-config-samba}
using \code{synaptic} or \code{apt-get}, 

Create the \code{$HOME/common} directory.

Using the Menusystem, open the \code{samba} configuration utility.

\begin{verbatim}
Program->System Tools->Administration->Samba
\end{verbatim}

In the server configuration, make sure your workgroup is {\bf emagii} during the labs.

Export the \code{common} directory.

Make it visible and writeable and give access to everyone.

If you want the teacher to be able to access your lab directory, 
you should create the user \teacher, and export the \labdir directory,
making it visible and writeable to \teacher.

After reconfiguring samba, you need to restart with the new configuration.

\begin{verbatim}
sudo service smbd restart
sudo service nmbd restart
\end{verbatim}
