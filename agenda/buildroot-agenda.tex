    {\bf Prerequisites} & {\bf Knowledge of embedded Linux} as covered
    in our embedded Linux training
    (\url{http://free-electrons.com/training/embedded-linux/}) \newline 
    {\bf Knowledge and practice of Unix or GNU/Linux commands}

    {\bf Required equipment} &
    {\bf For on-site sessions only.}
    \newline Everything is supplied by Free Electrons in public
    sessions.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Video projector
    \item PC computers with at least 2 GB of RAM, and Ubuntu Linux
    installed in a {\bf free partition of at least 20 GB. Using Linux
      in a virtual machine is not supported}, because of issues
    connecting to real hardware.
    \item We need Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 (32 or 64 bit, Xubuntu and
    Kubuntu variants are fine). We don't support other
    distributions, because we can't test all possible package versions.
    \item {\bf Connection to the Internet} (direct or through the
    company proxy).
    \item {\bf PC computers with valuable data must be backed up}
    before being used in our sessions.  Some people have already made
    mistakes during our sessions and damaged work data.
    \end{itemize} \\
    \hline

    {\bf Materials} & Print and electronic copies of presentations and
    labs.
    \newline Electronic copy of lab files.\\
