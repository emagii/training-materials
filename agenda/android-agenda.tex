    {\bf Audience} & Engineers porting Android to new boards
    \newline Engineers developing products with Android \\
    \hline

    {\bf Prerequisites} & {\bf Knowledge and practice of Unix or
      GNU/Linux commands}
    \newline People lacking experience on this topic should get
    trained by themselves with the freely available on-line slides
    (\url{http://free-electrons.com/docs/command-line/})

    {\bf Required equipment} & \vspace{-0.7cm}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Video projector
    \item PC computers with at least 4 GB of RAM, a CPU at least
      equivalent to an \hostmachine and Ubuntu Linux installed in a
      {\bf free partition of at least \hostfreespace. Using Linux in a virtual
        machine is not supported}, because of issues connecting to
      real hardware.
    \item We need \hostos. We don't support other distributions,
      because we can't test all possible package versions.
    \item {\bf High Speed Connection to the Internet} (direct or
      through the company proxy), fast enough to download the several
      gigabytes of Android source code.
    \item {\bf PC computers with valuable data must be backed up}
      before being used in our sessions. Some people have already made
      mistakes during our sessions and damaged work data.
    \item It is a good idea to do a fresh install on a new disk
      which subsuquently can be used as an external USB disk.
